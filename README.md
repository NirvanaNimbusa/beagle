# DebugMenu (Android)
*Add a smart side drawer to your applications to simplify development.*

This library is in a very early stage of development.

### Usage
Add the following to your top level Gradle file:

```groovy
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url "https://jitpack.io" }
    }
}
```

...and this to the module-level build script:

```groovy
debugImplementation "com.github.pandulapeter.debug-menu:debug-menu:0.0.2"
releaseImplementation "com.github.pandulapeter.debug-menu:debug-menu-noop:0.0.2"
```

The library has to be initialized in the Application class. See the example module for details.
