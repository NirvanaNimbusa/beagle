Beagle is a free, open-source library that adds a smart and customizable debug menu to the internal builds of your Android apps.\n\n
After choosing a UI dependency that determines the way the menu is displayed (Activity, BottomSheet, Dialog, Drawer or View), the library can be initialized with a single line of code in the onCreate() method of a custom Application class:</string>
    <string name="home_welcome_snippet">Beagle.initialize(this)</string>
    <string name="home_welcome_hint_2">In this demo you can trigger the debug menu at any time by shaking the device or by tapping on the Beagle logo in the bottom-right corner.\n\n
Check out how the following case studies take advantage of Beagle!</string>
