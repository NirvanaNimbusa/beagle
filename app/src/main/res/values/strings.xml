    <!-- Setup -->
    <string name="setup_title">Setup</string>
    <string name="setup_text_1"><b>Welcome!</b>\n\nBeagle is a free and open-source library that adds a smart and easily customizable debug menu to the internal builds of your Android apps.</string>
    <string name="setup_github_button">Check it out on GitHub</string>
    <string name="setup_hint">In this demo application you can trigger the debug menu at any time by shaking the device (one decided shake is enough, think of your phone as a judge\'s gavel), or by tapping on the Beagle logo in the bottom-right corner.\n\nThe following sections provide some guidance with setting up the library while the rest of the app serves as a demo / showcase for the built-in feature set.\n</string>
    <string name="setup_header_2">Initialization</string>
    <string name="setup_text_2">The first step towards having Beagle in your project is making sure that the JitPack Maven repository is added to the <i>allprojects</i> block of your project-level <i>build.gradle</i> file.</string>
    <string name="setup_text_3">The library offers five variants that display the debug menu in different ways. The next step is selecting the one that fits your application\'s needs the most…</string>
    <string name="setup_variant_activity">Activity</string>
    <string name="setup_variant_bottom_sheet">Bottom sheet</string>
    <string name="setup_variant_dialog">Dialog</string>
    <string name="setup_variant_drawer">Drawer</string>
    <string name="setup_variant_view">View</string>
    <string name="setup_text_4">…and adding the following dependencies to the module-level <i>build.gradle</i> file:</string>
    <string name="setup_text_5">Specifying the <i>noop</i> variant for release builds ensures that none of Beagle\'s functionality makes its way to production, but you can still use the same public API without getting compilation errors.\n\nAfter adding the dependencies, the library can be initialized with a single line of code in the <i>onCreate()</i> method of your custom <i>Application</i> class:</string>
    <string name="setup_header_3">Module configuration</string>
    <string name="setup_text_6">At this point, if you run your app, you should be able to trigger an empty debug menu. To make it more useful, we should configure a list of modules.</string>
    <string name="setup_text_7">Beagle provides multiple ways to set or change the list of modules, the simplest of which is calling:</string>
    <string name="setup_text_8">This function can be called at any time, from any thread, to replace the current configuration with a new list of modules (provided as varargs).\n\nIn case you only want to change some parts of the debug menu without affecting the others, there are functions that give you more granular control over the modules.\n\nFor adding one or more modules you can use this:</string>
    <string name="setup_text_9">In this function, the optional <i>placement</i> parameter can be used to specify the position of the new modules (first, last, or above / below a module that\'s already part of the menu). Specifying the optional <i>lifecycleOwner</i> will automatically remove the modules when that lifecycle is over, which is ideal for elements that are specific to a single screen.\n\nThe following function exists for manually removing one or more modules from the debug menu, using their ID-s:</string>
    <string name="setup_text_10">As you can see, ID-s must be unique for modules: if two instances are added with the same ID, only one will be handled. Most modules automatically generate a unique ID for themselves that you only need to override in special cases, but some of them don\'t support this option as they were designed to be added only once. The ID-s for these types of modules are public constants in the module class: <i>ModuleName.ID</i>.\n\nLast but not least, the following function is exposed to get you the reference for an already added module instance:</string>
    <string name="setup_text_11">Check out the rest of this demo to see what you can achieve with the built-in modules. The <i>Examples</i> page contains a list of case studies showcasing various situations where Beagle can be useful (with code snippets to show how each specific debug menu is created), while the <i>Playground</i> page provides an interactive tool for previewing any possible combination of modules.</string>
    <string name="setup_header_4">Troubleshooting</string>
    <string name="setup_text_12">In case of the Drawer UI, if you have overwritten the Activity\'s <i>onBackPressed()</i> method, you might notice that the default back navigation handling does not always work as expected. To fix this, in every Activity\'s <i>onBackPressed()</i> you should check that <i>Beagle.hide()</i> returns false before doing any other checks or calling the super implementation:</string>
    <string name="setup_text_13">If you can\'t seem to trigger Beagle in your app, make sure you\'re not adding any Fragments to the container with the ID <i>android.R.id.content</i> (if that\'s the case, introducing another FrameLayout into the View hierarchy for debug builds is a simple fix to the problem).\n\nIf you find any undocumented problems, feel free to reach out and open an issue on GitHub - I\'ll be quick to respond.</string>
    <string name="setup_debug_menu_text_1"><b>This is the debug menu configured by you</b>\n\nIt should contain useful information, like the version number of your app, the build date, or information on the device it\'s running on.\n\nYou can use it to track network requests, show analytics events, display custom logs, session-related data, or anything that you consider useful for debugging potential issues or simplifying the testing process.\n\nIt can also contain various interactive features, such as switches, radio groups, buttons, sliders, etc. that you can use to set up a \"God mode\" during development.</string>
    <string name="setup_debug_menu_app_info_button">Show app info</string>
    <string name="setup_debug_menu_screenshot_button">Take a screenshot</string>
    <string name="setup_debug_menu_keyline_overlay_switch"><b>Draw keyline overlay</b></string>

    <!-- Examples -->
    <string name="examples_title">Examples</string>
    <string name="examples_text">The module configuration very much depends on your application\'s specific needs, so there is no single setup that will be ideal for every situation.\n\nThe following examples demonstrate some of the library\'s features while also describing how they are implemented.

    <string name="case_study_simple_setup_text_1">Open the debug menu to check out its features. The current module configuration is initialized using the following code snippet:</string>
    <string name="case_study_simple_setup_text_2">All of these modules can be customized by specifying some optional parameters, but for this example the default values are used. Let\'s see what each individual module does:\n</string>
    <string name="case_study_simple_setup_app_info_button_1"><b>AppInfoButton</b></string>
    <string name="case_study_simple_setup_app_info_button_2">A shortcut to the system settings page of your app. Can be useful if you need quick access to clearing the storage, for example.\n\nThe optional <i>shouldOpenInNewTask</i> parameter can be used to specify the <i>FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK</i> Intent flag for the new Activity.</string>
    <string name="case_study_simple_setup_developer_options_button_1"><b>DeveloperOptionsButton</b></string>
    <string name="case_study_simple_setup_developer_options_button_2">A shortcut to the system\'s Developer Options page.\n\nThe optional <i>shouldOpenInNewTask</i> parameter can be used to specify the <i>FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK</i> Intent flag for the new Activity.</string>
    <string name="case_study_simple_setup_force_crash_button_1"><b>ForceCrashButton</b></string>
    <string name="case_study_simple_setup_force_crash_button_2">This module can be used to easily test the application\'s crash reporting capabilities.</string>
    <string name="case_study_simple_setup_screenshot_button_1"><b>ScreenshotButton</b></string>
    <string name="case_study_simple_setup_screenshot_button_2">Create a screenshot image of the current screen and bring up the system\'s Share bottom sheet, when done.\n\nThe image will be saved in the app\'s private cache folder and exposed using a FileProvider to avoid asking for storage permission.\n\nBelow Android 5.0 the drawing cache of the root view will be used which is not ideal: system decorations or dialogs might not be visible. On Android 5.0 and above the MediaProjectionManager API is used which creates a proper screenshot, but requires the user to give their permission every time (due to privacy concerns).\n\nSome aspects of the screenshot flow can be customized using the <i>Appearance</i> and <i>Behavior</i> objects that were provided when initializing Beagle.</string>
    <string name="case_study_simple_setup_screen_recording_button_1"><b>ScreenRecordingButton</b></string>
    <string name="case_study_simple_setup_screen_recording_button_2">Create a video recording of the current screen and bring up the system\'s Share bottom sheet, when done.\n\nThe recording is handled by a foreground service and a system notification will be present for the entire duration of the recording. The capture can be stopped by tapping on that notification.\n\nThe video will be saved in the app\'s private cache folder and exposed using a FileProvider to avoid asking for storage permission.\n\nThe implementation relies on the MediaProjectionManager API which is only available on Android 5.0 and above, and requires the user to give their permission every time (due to privacy concerns).\n\nSome aspects of the screen recording flow can be customized using the <i>Appearance</i> and <i>Behavior</i> objects that were provided when initializing Beagle.</string>
    <string name="case_study_simple_setup_keyline_overlay_switch_1"><b>KeylineOverlaySwitchModule</b></string>
    <string name="case_study_simple_setup_keyline_overlay_switch_2">This switch can be very useful when trying to create pixel-perfect layouts. The color and dimensions of the overlay grid are configurable, but the default values follow the Material Design specifications for mobile and tablet.</string>
    <string name="case_study_simple_setup_animation_duration_switch_1"><b>AnimationDurationSwitch</b></string>
    <string name="case_study_simple_setup_animation_duration_switch_2">A frequent use case for this toggle is debugging animation or transition glitches. Check out how it affects this loading indicator:</string>
    <string name="case_study_simple_setup_device_info_1"><b>DeviceInfo</b></string>
    <string name="case_study_simple_setup_device_info_2">Displays important information about the device such as the Android SDK version or the screen resolution that can be helpful in identifying device-specific issues.</string>

    <!-- Case studies / Static data -->
    <string name="case_study_static_data_title">Static data</string>
    <string name="case_study_static_data_description">Ways to display potentially useful information about the build, the environment or the session.</string>
    <string name="case_study_static_data_top_1">Here are all the modules used in this example:</string>
    <string name="case_study_static_data_top_2">Again, let\'s discuss them individually, in detail.\n</string>
    <string name="case_study_static_data_header_1"><b>Header</b></string>
    <string name="case_study_static_data_header_2">This module applies a specific formatting to three (optional) pieces of text. The variables for the current configuration are defined the following way:</string>
    <string name="case_study_static_data_header_3">The last line uses a custom build config field:</string>
    <string name="case_study_static_data_header_4">A setup like this is usually a good candidate for the first item of the debug menu as it displays all the important metadata about the build at a glance.</string>
    <string name="case_study_static_data_text_1"><b>Text</b></string>
    <string name="case_study_static_data_text_2">One of the simplest modules, displaying just a piece of text. Please note that all modules that deal with text drawn on the UI expect <i>CharSequence</i> instead of <i>String</i>. As a result, while Strings are perfectly fine, spannables can also be used to spice things up with special formatting.</string>
    <string name="case_study_static_data_long_text_1"><b>LongText</b></string>
    <string name="case_study_static_data_long_text_2">Similar to TextModule, but the main content (<i>text</i> parameter) can be collapsed into a header (<i>title</i> parameter). The <i>isExpandedInitially</i> parameter can be used to specify whether or not the content should be expanded the first time the user opens the debug menu.</string>
    <string name="case_study_static_data_label_1"><b>Label</b></string>
    <string name="case_study_static_data_label_2">Basically a TextModule with bold formatting, where the <i>text</i> parameter has been renamed to <i>title</i>. Ideal for short section headers.</string>
    <string name="case_study_static_data_padding_1"><b>Padding</b></string>
    <string name="case_study_static_data_padding_2">Adds 8dp of empty space to the debug menu. Feel free to add more than one instances if more space is needed.</string>
    <string name="case_study_static_data_divider_1"><b>Divider</b></string>
    <string name="case_study_static_data_divider_2">A 1dp tall, horizontal line that uses the default text color of the theme.</string>
    <string name="case_study_static_data_key_value_list_1"><b>KeyValueList</b></string>
    <string name="case_study_static_data_key_value_list_2">Similar to LongTextModule in its expand-collapse behavior, but instead of a single text parameter for its main content, this module expects a list of CharSequence Pairs. The keys for each entry will automatically become bold.</string>
    <string name="case_study_static_data_module_text_1">This <i>piece of text</i> <u><b>contains</b> parts</u> with <b><i>special</i></b> <i><u>formatting</u></i>.</string>
    <string name="case_study_static_data_module_label_1">Labels can be used to separate content, but adding spaces…</string>
    <string name="case_study_static_data_module_text_2">…or dividers…</string>
    <string name="case_study_static_data_module_text_3">…can also be useful.</string>
    <string name="case_study_static_data_module_text_4">Longer pieces of content can be made expandable.</string>
    <string name="case_study_static_data_module_text_5">This helps reduce visual clutter and also acts as a way to organize the debug menu.</string>
    <string name="case_study_static_data_module_key_value_title">Another way to display information is to group it into key-value pairs.</string>
    <string name="case_study_static_data_module_key_1">Key 1</string>
    <string name="case_study_static_data_module_value_1">Value 1</string>
    <string name="case_study_static_data_module_key_2">Key 2</string>
    <string name="case_study_static_data_module_value_2">Value 2</string>
    <string name="case_study_static_data_module_key_3">Key 3</string>
    <string name="case_study_static_data_module_value_3">Value 3</string>

    <!-- Case studies / Feature flags -->
    <string name="case_study_feature_flags_title">Feature flags</string>
    <string name="case_study_feature_flags_description">Test different implementations without creating new builds, and persist these settings across app launches with a single extra line of code.</string>
    <string name="case_study_feature_flags_text_1">Enabling / disabling some toggles or changing some specific part of the configuration at runtime is one of the most important use cases for a debug menu. This example showcases all the ways Beagle can help you achieve this.\n\nObserve how the values in the card below are updated in real-time as you modify the flags in the debug menu:</string>
    <string name="case_study_feature_flags_current_state_on">ON</string>
    <string name="case_study_feature_flags_current_state_off">OFF</string>
    <string name="case_study_feature_flags_current_state_key_1">"• Toggle 1: "</string>

    <string name="case_study_feature_flags_current_state_key_8">"\n• Text input: "</string>
    <string name="case_study_feature_flags_switch"><b>Switch</b></string>
    <string name="case_study_feature_flags_switch_description_1">The simplest way to initialize a Switch module is providing a text parameter together with a callback lambda, which will be invoked with the Boolean argument of the new state every time the user toggles the switch:</string>
    <string name="case_study_feature_flags_switch_description_2">Initially the switch will be off, but this can be changed by overriding the default value of the <i>initialValue</i> parameter.</string>
    <string name="case_study_feature_flags_check_box"><b>CheckBox</b></string>
    <string name="case_study_feature_flags_check_box_description">Check boxes can be initialized in a very similar way to switches and they support the same functionality. The only difference is the name of the module:</string>
    <string name="case_study_feature_flags_multiple_selection_list"><b>MultipleSelectionList</b></string>
    <string name="case_study_feature_flags_multiple_selection_list_description_1">For items that are grouped together into a list we should create a model class representation for list items that implements the <i>BeagleListItemContract</i> interface:</string>
    <string name="case_study_feature_flags_multiple_selection_list_description_2">After this we can define the module by specifying a list of items as well as a title for the list, the set of the initial selection ID-s and the callback (which will be invoked with the set of currently selected items as its argument).</string>
    <string name="case_study_feature_flags_single_selection_list"><b>SingleSelectionList</b></string>
    <string name="case_study_feature_flags_single_selection_list_description_1">In case of radio buttons, the important difference compared to the previous example is that at most a single item can be selected at any given time. As a result, there is no need to deal with sets any more:</string>
    <string name="case_study_feature_flags_single_selection_list_description_2">The module supports not having an initial selection, so both the <i>initiallySelectedItemId</i> parameter and the argument of the <i>onSelectionChanged</i> lambda are nullable.</string>
    <string name="case_study_feature_flags_slider"><b>Slider</b></string>
    <string name="case_study_feature_flags_slider_description_1">Adjusting the value of an integer within a specified range can be done using the SliderModule:</string>
    <string name="case_study_feature_flags_slider_description_2">One interesting aspect to note here is that the <i>text</i> displayed on top of the seek bar is defined as a lambda that receives the current value (after every change event) and returns a CharSequence.\n\nThe optional parameters to configure the behavior of the slider are <i>minimumValue</i>, <i>maximumValue</i> and <i>initialValue</i> (the latter defaults to <i>minimumValue</i>, if not specified).</string>
    <string name="case_study_feature_flags_text_input"><b>TextInput</b></string>
    <string name="case_study_feature_flags_text_input_description_1">Somewhat similar in API to Slider but this module deals with a String value instead of an Int.</string>
    <string name="case_study_feature_flags_text_input_description_2">The item itself is just a clickable text, that brings up a dialog which contains the actual text input. The <i>areRealTimeUpdatesEnabled</i> parameter controls whether or not the value should be updated after every keystroke (and as a result, the callback will be invoked on every change event), or only after the user presses the Done button. The <i>validator</i> lambda exposes the option to reject certain values, while <i>doneText</i> and <i>cancelText</i> can be used to customize the appearance of the dialog.</string>
    <string name="case_study_feature_flags_querying_and_changing_the_current_value"><b>Querying and changing the current value</b></string>
    <string name="case_study_feature_flags_querying_and_changing_the_current_value_description_1">In case using the callbacks for the modules above is not enough, the current state can be queried at any time using this (somewhat cumbersome) function:</string>
    <string name="case_study_feature_flags_querying_and_changing_the_current_value_description_2">A similar setter also exists to modify the state programatically.</string>
    <string name="case_study_feature_flags_querying_and_changing_the_current_value_description_3">Any changes made this way will also update the UI. Give it a try with this button:</string>
    <string name="case_study_feature_flags_querying_and_changing_the_current_value_description_4">To use any of these methods, a reference to the module is needed. The simplest way to get that is saving it at the moment of instantiation, but if that is not convenient for some reason, the library\'s <i>find()</i> function can also be used.</string>
    <string name="case_study_feature_flags_querying_and_changing_the_current_value_description_5">Please note that this will return null if the module is not currently added to the debug menu, but it will throw a <i>ClassCastException</i> if the module was found with a different type, than expected.</string>
    <string name="case_study_feature_flags_reset_all">Reset all</string>
    <string name="case_study_feature_flags_state_reset">All values were reset</string>
    <string name="case_study_feature_flags_persisting_state"><b>Persisting state</b></string>
    <string name="case_study_feature_flags_persisting_state_description">All of the modules discussed in this example have the optional <i>isValuePersisted</i> constructor parameter, which is set to false by default. Setting it to true AND providing a unique module ID (the auto-generated random value is inconsistent between app launches) will automatically save and restore the state of the module to / from <i>SharedPreferences</i>.\n\nIf the value is persisted, the <i>initialValue</i> / <i>initiallySelectedItemIds</i> / <i>initiallySelectedItemId</i> parameters are only taken into consideration when there is no data saved on the local storage.\n\nLastly, the callbacks of persisted modules are invoked when the module is added to the debug menu so that any custom logic that happens on manual selection could also be executed when the state is restored.\n\nThe current demo configuration saves and restores all the modules on this screen.</string>
    <string name="case_study_feature_flags_bulk_apply"><b>Bulk apply</b></string>
    <string name="case_study_feature_flags_bulk_apply_description_1_off">Right now all manual changes made to the modules are applied instantaneously. You can change that:</string>
    <string name="case_study_feature_flags_bulk_apply_description_1_on">Right now all manual changes made to the modules are only applied after a confirmation. You can change that:</string>
    <string name="case_study_feature_flags_require_confirmation"><i>Require confirmation for all modules</i></string>
    <string name="case_study_feature_flags_bulk_apply_description_2">By setting the <i>shouldRequireConfirmation</i> parameter to true for any of the modules presented in this example, users will be given the option to Apply or Reset the changes they made. This means that the library will accumulate pending change events and invoke the necessary callbacks in bulk when the user presses the Apply button.\n\nModifying the values from code will still have instantaneous effect. The texts that appear on the Apply and Reset buttons can be changed in the optional <i>Appearance</i> object provided while initializing Beagle.</string>

    <string name="case_study_network_request_interceptor_text_4">The cumbersome casting was the only way to avoid the noop variant depending on OkHttp, sorry about that.\n\nIf, for some reason, you cannot use this interceptor (for example in case of socket-based API-s), the library exposes the <i>Beagle.logNetworkEvent(…)</i> function which populates the same module. Furthermore, you can use <i>Beagle.clearNetworkLogs()</i> to reset the list at any time.</string>
    <string name="case_study_network_request_interceptor_clear_logs">Clear logs</string>
    <string name="case_study_network_request_interceptor_logs_cleared">Logs cleared</string>
    <string name="case_study_network_request_interceptor_text_5">\nAs usual, the optional arguments of the module constructor can be used to fine-tune its behavior:\n  • Specifying a <i>baseUrl</i> is a good idea in most cases to avoid having the same URL prefix for every single entry.\n  • <i>maxItemCount</i> limits the total number of entries displayed in the list (and defaults to 10, when not specified).\n  • The <i>timestampFormatter</i> lambda can be used to override the way the timestamps of the events are displayed (or set to null to remove displaying timestamps altogether).\n\nThe library also provides a way to listen to any updates made to the list of network log events through the <i>NetworkLogListener</i> interface which can be used with the <i>Beagle.addNetworkLogListener()</i>, <i>Beagle.removeNetworkLogListener()</i>, and <i>Beagle.clearNetworkLogListeners()</i> functions.</string>

    <!-- Case studies / Analytics -->
    <string name="case_study_analytics_title">Logging analytics events</string>
    <string name="case_study_analytics_description">Making sure that every required event is tracked from an admin panel can be cumbersome. Why not display the events right in the app, in real time?</string>
    <string name="case_study_analytics_module_title">Analytics events</string>
    <string name="case_study_analytics_text_1">Check out how any state change made to the following four check boxes is tracked by the debug menu:\n</string>
    <string name="case_study_analytics_toggle_1">Toggle 1</string>
    <string name="case_study_analytics_toggle_2">Toggle 2</string>
    <string name="case_study_analytics_toggle_3">Toggle 3</string>
    <string name="case_study_analytics_toggle_4">Toggle 4</string>
    <string name="case_study_analytics_text_2">This was achieved using Beagle\'s logging capabilities (and logging analytics events is of course just a small subset of the potential use cases for the feature). A single log() function is invoked every time a change is made:</string>
    <string name="case_study_analytics_text_3">The <i>tag</i> parameter is optional, and is there to help with filtering, as multiple instances of LogListModule can be present at any time in the menu, each distinguished by the tag they are set up to track. If no tag is provided for the module, it will display all log messages.</string>
    <string name="case_study_analytics_text_4">All of the parameters from the constructor above are optional and have reasonable default values.\n\nThe list of log entries can be cleared any time using:</string>
    <string name="case_study_analytics_text_5">Again, not providing a tag would signal the intention of clearing all messages, regardless of tag. See it in action:</string>
    <string name="case_study_analytics_text_6">\nLast bug not least, it is worth pointing out that, similarly to the NetworkLogListModule, we have the option to override the default timestmap formatting using the <i>timestampFormatter</i> parameter, and listen to changes with the <i>LogListener</i> interface (used with the <i>Beagle.addLogListener()</i>, <i>Beagle.removeLogListener()</i>, and <i>Beagle.clearLogListeners()</i> functions).</string>

    <string name="case_study_authentication_text_2">To define a module that helps in this situation, first we need to create a representation of a test account:</string>
    <string name="case_study_authentication_text_3">Extending <i>BeagleListItemContract</i> is a must as it provides information to the library about a unique identifier for the model (in this case the email address is good enough), and the actual text that is displayed on the UI.\n\nThe next step is creating the module:</string>
    <string name="case_study_authentication_text_4">To simplify the flow further, in the callback lambda we\'re hiding the debug menu and simulating the button press to proceed with the sign in flow.\n\nAnother idea to save time is to automatically display the debug menu when the screen is opened, simply by calling:</string>
    <string name="case_study_authentication_text_5">You can test this implementation by toggling the \"Show automatically\" switch and re-opening this screen.</string>
