    <string name="setup_hint">In this demo application you can trigger the debug menu at any time by shaking the device (one decided shake is enough, think of your phone as a judge\'s gavel), swiping from the right side of the screen or by tapping on the Beagle logo in the bottom-right corner.\n\nThe following sections provide some guidance with setting up the library while the rest of the application serves as a demo / showcase for the built-in feature set.</string>
